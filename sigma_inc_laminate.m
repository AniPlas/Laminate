% This MATLAB code computes the effective behavior (effective stiffness tensor and the effective plastic strain tensor) and 
% the stress fields in an N-phase laminate with planar interface. 
% The laminate is submitted to a macroscopic homogeneous and remotely applied stress as well as to piecewise uniform plastic strains. 
% The phases of the laminate can have different grain volume fractions and can correspond to different materials or crystals
% The phases are assumed perfectly bonded  along the planar interface whose normal is along e2. 
% The code below is an application for a beta-titanium alloy with elongated grains loading in elasticity only, 
% modeled as laminate made of 100,000 different orientations and equal volume fraction.
% At the end, the maximal von Mises stress is plotted with respect to theta, a rotation around e3 of the uniaxial stress of magnitude 300 MPa.
% A reference for the model can be found in:

% The contracted Voigt notation (11:1, 22: 2, 33: 3, 23: 4, 31:5, 12: 6) is used for stresses and strains in vector notation and 
% stiffnesses and compliances in 6x6 matrix notation.
